# SOP Module Implementation Plan
## Comprehensive Backend Implementation with Rollback Strategy

### Problem Analysis
The SOP module has a complete frontend implementation but is missing the entire backend infrastructure:

**✅ Frontend Complete:**
- TypeScript types and interfaces
- Service layer with all API calls
- UI components (Upload, Detail, Builder, Conversion, Assignments)
- Routing and navigation integration

**❌ Backend Missing:**
- No `/api/sops/*` routes
- No controllers, services, or models
- No database tables or migrations
- Frontend expects 20+ different API endpoints that don't exist

### Implementation Strategy: Phased Approach with Rollbacks

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Low Risk)
**Goal:** Basic SOP CRUD operations
**Rollback:** Simple - delete new files, skip route registration

### Tasks:
1. **Create SOP database migration with rollback**
   - Design schema for: sop_documents, sop_steps, sop_executions
   - Include proper DOWN migration for easy rollback
   - Test migration/rollback cycle before deployment

2. **Implement basic SOP backend (isolated)**
   - Create SOP models (isolated from existing code)
   - Create SOP service (isolated from existing services)
   - Create SOP routes (separate file)
   - **DO NOT register routes yet**

3. **Test backend in isolation**
   - Unit tests for models and services
   - Integration tests for database operations
   - Manual API testing with Postman/curl

### Rollback Strategy Phase 1:
- Delete new migration file
- Delete new backend files
- Restart application - no impact on existing functionality

---

## Phase 2: Basic API Integration (Medium Risk)
**Goal:** Connect frontend to basic CRUD operations
**Rollback:** Comment out route registration, restart API

### Tasks:
4. **Register core SOP routes (feature flag approach)**
   - Add SOP routes to index.js with feature flag
   - Environment variable: `ENABLE_SOP_MODULE=true`
   - Default: disabled for production safety

5. **Test basic SOP functionality**
   - Create SOP documents
   - Read SOP documents
   - Update SOP documents
   - Delete SOP documents

6. **Deploy with safety measures**
   - Deploy to development first
   - Test all existing functionality still works
   - Monitor API health and error rates

### Rollback Strategy Phase 2:
- Set `ENABLE_SOP_MODULE=false`
- Restart API service
- All SOP routes become unavailable but existing functionality unaffected

---

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Higher Risk)
**Goal:** Full SOP functionality matching frontend expectations
**Rollback:** Granular feature flags for each component

### Tasks:
7. **Implement SOP execution system**
   - Execution tracking
   - Step completion
   - Progress monitoring

8. **Implement property assignments**
   - SOP-to-property relationships
   - Assignment management
   - Compliance tracking

9. **Implement conversion features**
   - SOP-to-checklist conversion
   - Checklist-to-SOP conversion
   - Conversion history tracking

10. **Add training and attachment features**
    - Training record management
    - File upload/attachment system
    - Document storage integration

### Rollback Strategy Phase 3:
- Granular feature flags for each component
- Ability to disable individual features without affecting core SOP functionality
- Database rollbacks for each feature addition

---

## Safety Measures Throughout

### 1. Database Safety
- Every migration includes proper DOWN function
- Test migrations on copy of production data first
- Database backups before each phase deployment
- Ability to rollback database schema changes

### 2. API Safety
- Feature flags for each SOP component
- Gradual rollout (dev → staging → production)
- Health checks and monitoring
- Circuit breaker patterns for new endpoints

### 3. Code Safety
- Branch-based development with clear rollback points
- Isolated implementation (no changes to existing code)
- Comprehensive testing at each phase
- Docker image versioning for rapid rollback

### 4. Deployment Safety
```bash
# Safe deployment process
1. Deploy new API version with SOP routes disabled
2. Run database migrations with rollback tested
3. Enable SOP module with feature flag
4. Monitor system health
5. If issues: disable feature flag → rollback migration → restart service
```

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk:**
- Creating isolated backend files
- Database migrations (with tested rollbacks)
- Development environment testing

**Medium Risk:**
- Registering new routes
- Connecting frontend to backend
- Initial production deployment

**High Risk:**
- Complex features (conversions, executions)
- File upload/storage integration
- Cross-module integrations

## Rollback Decision Matrix

| Issue Type | Rollback Action | Recovery Time |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| API errors | Disable feature flag | 30 seconds |
| Database issues | Rollback migration | 2-5 minutes |
| Frontend integration issues | Disable route registration | 1 minute |
| Data corruption | Restore database backup | 5-15 minutes |
| Complete failure | Revert to previous Docker image | 2-3 minutes |

## Prerequisites for Implementation

1. **Backup Strategy**
   - Full database backup before starting
   - Application state snapshot
   - Configuration backup

2. **Monitoring Setup**
   - API health endpoints
   - Error rate monitoring
   - Performance baseline measurement

3. **Testing Environment**
   - Isolated development environment
   - Staging environment that mirrors production
   - Load testing capability

## Success Criteria

**Phase 1 Success:**
- SOP backend code compiles and tests pass
- Database migration runs successfully
- No impact on existing functionality

**Phase 2 Success:**
- Basic SOP CRUD operations work through API
- Frontend SOP pages load without errors
- All existing functionality remains operational

**Phase 3 Success:**
- Complete SOP workflow functional
- SOP-to-checklist conversion works
- Performance meets requirements
- All rollback procedures tested and functional

## Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 1:** 1-2 days (Backend infrastructure)
- **Phase 2:** 1-2 days (Basic integration + testing)
- **Phase 3:** 2-3 days (Advanced features)
- **Testing/Rollback validation:** 1 day

**Total: 5-8 days with comprehensive safety measures**

This approach ensures we can safely implement the SOP module while maintaining system stability and having clear rollback procedures at every step.
