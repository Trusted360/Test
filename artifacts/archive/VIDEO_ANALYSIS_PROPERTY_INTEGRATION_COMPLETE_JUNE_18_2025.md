# Video Analysis Property Integration - Implementation Complete

**Date**: June 18, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Issue Resolved**: Video Analysis needs to identify what property the video event relates to and tie into properties configurations

## Problem Statement

The video analysis system was missing the ability to:
- Identify which property a video event relates to
- Automatically trigger appropriate checklist templates based on property configuration
- Link video events to the property's checklist system

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Video Controller (`src/api/controllers/video.controller.js`)

**Key Improvements:**
- **Property Identification**: Enhanced `createAlert` function to automatically identify the property through camera-property relationships
- **Enhanced Alert Data**: Video alerts now include property context in `alert_data_json`:
  ```json
  {
    "property_id": 1,
    "property_name": "Downtown Office Complex", 
    "property_type_code": "commercial",
    "camera_location": "main_entrance",
    "processed_at": "2025-06-18T20:47:06.605Z"
  }
  ```

**Auto-Automation Features:**
- **Service Ticket Creation**: Automatically creates service tickets when `auto_create_ticket` is enabled
- **Checklist Generation**: Automatically creates appropriate checklists when `auto_create_checklist` is enabled
- **Template Selection**: Intelligently selects the correct video event response template based on:
  - Alert type (fire/smoke → Emergency template)
  - Security events (unauthorized access → Security template)  
  - Equipment issues → Maintenance template

### 2. New API Endpoints Added

**Property Video Configuration:**
- `GET /api/video/property/:propertyId/config` - Get comprehensive property video setup
- `POST /api/video/property/:propertyId/demo-alert` - Generate property-specific demo alerts

**Enhanced Reporting:**
- `GET /api/video/alerts-with-checklists` - View alerts with their generated checklists

### 3. Database Integration

**Existing Schema Utilized:**
- `camera_feeds` table links cameras to properties via `property_id`
- `video_alerts` table enhanced with property context in `alert_data_json`
- `alert_generated_checklists` table tracks auto-generated checklists from alerts
- `property_checklists` table receives auto-generated checklists

## Testing Results

### Test Case: Unauthorized Access Alert

**Input:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/api/video/alerts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [token]" \
  -d '{
    "camera_id": 1,
    "alert_type_id": 1,
    "severity": "high", 
    "status": "active"
  }'
```

**Results:**
✅ **Alert Created** with property context:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "camera_name": "Main Entrance Camera",
  "camera_location": "main_entrance", 
  "property_name": "Downtown Office Complex",
  "alert_type_name": "Unauthorized Access"
}
```

✅ **Service Ticket Auto-Created**:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Unauthorized Access - Downtown Office Complex",
  "description": "Auto-generated ticket from Unauthorized Access alert at Main Entrance Camera (main_entrance)",
  "property_name": "Downtown Office Complex"
}
```

✅ **Security Checklist Auto-Created**:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "property_name": "Downtown Office Complex",
  "template_name": "Video Event Response - Security",
  "completion_stats": {
    "total_items": 7,
    "completed_items": 0
  }
}
```

## System Flow

```
Video Event Detected
       ↓
Camera ID → Property Lookup
       ↓
Alert Created with Property Context
       ↓
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│   Auto-Create   │   Auto-Create   │
│ Service Ticket  │   Checklist     │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
       ↓                    ↓
Property-Specific      Template Selection
   Ticket Created      Based on Alert Type
```
