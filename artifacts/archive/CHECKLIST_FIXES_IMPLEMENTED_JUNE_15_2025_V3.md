### New Issues Fixed in V3

#### 1. ✅ Mark as Complete SQL Error Fixed
- **Issue**: `update "property_checklists" as "pc" set "status" = $1, "updated_at" = $2, "completed_at" = $3 where "pc"."id" = $4 and "p"."tenant_id" = $5 - missing FROM-clause entry for table "p"`
- **Root Cause**: The `updateChecklistStatus` method was trying to use a JOIN in an UPDATE statement, which is not valid SQL syntax
- **Fix**: 
  - Modified the method to first verify the checklist belongs to the tenant using a SELECT query
  - Then perform the UPDATE directly on the property_checklists table without joins
  - This maintains security while using valid SQL syntax

#### 2. ✅ File Attachment Download Fixed
- **Issue**: Unable to click file attachment - clicking resulted in 404 error
- **Root Cause**: 
  - No download endpoint existed for attachments
  - Frontend was trying to access a non-existent URL
- **Fix**: 
  - Added `GET /api/checklists/attachments/:attachmentId/download` endpoint
  - Implemented `getAttachment` method in ChecklistService with proper tenant verification
  - The endpoint streams the file with appropriate headers for download
  - Maintains security by verifying the attachment belongs to the tenant

## Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

1. **Updated checklist.service.js**
   ```javascript
   // Fixed updateChecklistStatus method
   async updateChecklistStatus(id, status, tenantId) {
     // First verify ownership, then update without join
   }
   
   // Added new method
   async getAttachment(attachmentId, tenantId) {
     // Get attachment with tenant verification
   }
   ```

2. **Updated checklist.routes.js**
   ```javascript
   // Added new route
   router.get('/attachments/:attachmentId/download', async (req, res) => {
     // Stream file with proper headers
   });
   ```

### Key Improvements

1. **SQL Query Fix**
   - Separated verification and update queries
   - Eliminated invalid JOIN in UPDATE statement
   - Maintains tenant isolation and security

2. **File Download Implementation**
   - Secure file streaming with tenant verification
   - Proper content headers for browser handling
   - Error handling for missing files
