# Video Analysis Implementation - June 16, 2025

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation and fixes for the video analysis and monitoring system in the Trusted360 application.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Service Ticket Creation Error (Fixed)
**Issue**: Error when clicking "Create Ticket" button
```
Error creating service ticket: Request failed with status code 404
XHR failed loading: POST "http://localhost:3001/api/video/service-tickets"
```

**Root Cause**: 
- The video API endpoints were not properly configured in the routes
- The video controller was missing comprehensive endpoint implementations
- Database table names in the controller didn't match the migration schema

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Created comprehensive video controller (`src/api/controllers/video.controller.js`) with all required endpoints:
   - Camera management (CRUD operations)
   - Alert management (create, read, resolve)
   - Alert types management
   - Service ticket creation and management
   - Statistics endpoints
   - Property-specific endpoints
   - Demo data generation

2. Updated API routes (`src/api/routes/index.js`) to include all video endpoints:
   ```javascript
   // Video routes
   router.get('/video/cameras', videoController.getCameras);
   router.post('/video/service-tickets', videoController.createServiceTicket);
   // ... and all other video endpoints
   ```

3. Fixed table name mismatches:
   - Changed `cameras` to `camera_feeds`
   - Changed `video_alert_types` to `alert_types`
   - Changed `video_service_tickets` to `service_tickets`

## Current Implementation Status

### Working Features:
1. **Video Feed Display**: Mock data displays correctly with event cards
2. **Event Filtering**: Severity and status filters work properly
3. **Event Actions**: 
   - View event details
   - Mark as resolved/reopen
   - Create checklist from event
   - Create service ticket from event (now fixed)
4. **Statistics Dashboard**: Shows event counts and metrics
5. **Camera Management**: List and manage camera feeds
6. **Alert System**: Create and manage video alerts

### Database Schema:
The video analysis system uses the following tables:
- `camera_feeds`: Video camera sources
- `alert_types`: Configurable alert categories
- `video_alerts`: Generated alerts from analysis
- `service_tickets`: Tickets created from alerts
- `alert_generated_checklists`: Links alerts to auto-created checklists

### API Endpoints:
All video-related endpoints are now properly configured:
- `/api/video/cameras` - Camera CRUD operations
- `/api/video/alerts` - Alert management
- `/api/video/alert-types` - Alert type configuration
- `/api/video/service-tickets` - Service ticket creation
- `/api/video/stats` - Analytics and statistics
- `/api/video/property/:id/*` - Property-specific endpoints
- `/api/video/demo/generate-alert` - Demo data generation

## Testing Instructions

1. Navigate to the Video Analysis page
2. Test the following functionality:
   - View video feed events
   - Filter by severity and status
   - Click on an event to view details
   - Create a service ticket from an event
   - Create a checklist from an event
   - Mark events as resolved/reopen
   - View camera list in the "Live Cameras" tab
   - Check analytics in the "Analytics" tab

## Next Steps

1. **Real Video Integration**: Replace mock data with actual video feed integration
2. **AI Analysis**: Implement actual AI/ML models for video analysis
3. **Real-time Updates**: Add WebSocket support for live alerts
4. **Video Playback**: Implement actual video streaming/playback
5. **Notification System**: Add real-time notifications for critical events
6. **Advanced Analytics**: Implement more detailed analytics and reporting

## Technical Notes

- The system uses mock data for demonstration purposes
- All database operations use Knex.js for query building
- The frontend uses Material-UI components for consistent styling
- Error handling includes proper HTTP status codes and error messages
- The API follows RESTful conventions with consistent response formats

## Dependencies

- Backend: Express.js, Knex.js, PostgreSQL
- Frontend: React, Material-UI, Axios
- Video Processing: Placeholder for future integration (e.g., FFmpeg, OpenCV)
