# Dashboard Fixes Complete - June 18, 2025

## Issues Addressed

The dashboard had several issues that were identified and resolved:

### 1. Active Alerts Section
**Problem**: Static text showing "No active alerts" instead of displaying actual video analysis alerts
**Solution**: 
- Added `loadActiveAlerts()` function to fetch real video alerts with status 'active'
- Implemented proper alert display with severity-based color coding
- Added navigation to video analysis page
- Shows alert type, camera location, property name, and timestamp
- Displays appropriate empty state when no alerts exist

### 2. Recent Checklist Display Names
**Problem**: Checklists showing "Untitled Checklist" when template names were missing
**Solution**:
- Created `getChecklistDisplayName()` function with fallback logic
- Priority order: template.name → template_name → generated name based on property and date
- Ensures meaningful names are always displayed

### 3. Recent Checklist Property Names
**Problem**: Checklists showing "No Property" even when properties were assigned
**Solution**:
- Updated property display logic to check multiple property field sources
- Now checks: `checklist.property?.name` → `checklist.property_name` → 'No Property'
- Handles both nested object and flat field property data

### 4. Video Analysis Events Section
**Problem**: Static placeholder text instead of actual video analysis data
**Solution**:
- Added `loadVideoEvents()` function to fetch recent video alerts
- Implemented scrollable list showing recent events (both active and resolved)
- Displays event details: alert type, camera, property, timestamp, severity, and status
- Added proper empty state with helpful messaging

### 5. Navigation to Specific Alert Details
**Problem**: Clicking on video alerts navigated to general video page instead of specific alert
**Solution**:
- Updated navigation to use specific alert IDs: `/video/alerts/${alert.id}`
- Both active alerts and video events now navigate to their specific detail pages
- Provides direct access to individual alert information and actions

## Technical Implementation

### New State Variables Added
```typescript
const [activeAlerts, setActiveAlerts] = useState<VideoAlert[]>([]);
const [alertsLoading, setAlertsLoading] = useState(true);
const [videoEvents, setVideoEvents] = useState<VideoAlert[]>([]);
const [videoEventsLoading, setVideoEventsLoading] = useState(true);
```

### New Functions Implemented
- `loadActiveAlerts()` - Fetches active video alerts
- `loadVideoEvents()` - Fetches recent video analysis events
- `getSeverityColor()` - Maps alert severity to Material-UI colors
- `getChecklistDisplayName()` - Generates meaningful checklist names

### UI Improvements
- Added proper loading states for all sections
- Implemented severity-based color coding for alerts
- Added navigation buttons to relevant pages
- Improved empty states with helpful icons and messaging
- Made all dashboard items clickable for better UX

## Data Integration

### Video Service Integration
- Integrated with existing `videoService.getAlerts()` API
- Supports filtering by status and limiting results
- Handles both active alerts and historical events

### Checklist Service Integration
- Enhanced existing checklist display logic
- Improved property name resolution
- Better template name handling

## Visual Enhancements

### Active Alerts
- Uses Material-UI Alert components with severity colors
- Critical/High: Red error color
- Medium: Orange warning color  
- Low: Blue info color
- Displays camera and property context

### Video Analysis Events
- Scrollable list with max height constraint
- Dual chip display for severity and status
- Resolved events show green success color
- Clickable items navigate to video analysis page

### Recent Checklists
- Improved naming with intelligent fallbacks
- Proper property name display
- Status chips with appropriate colors

## Testing Results

✅ **Active Alerts**: Now displays real video analysis alerts with proper severity indicators
✅ **Recent Checklists**: Shows meaningful names instead of "Untitled Checklist"  
✅ **Property Names**: Displays actual property names instead of "No Property"
✅ **Video Analysis Events**: Shows populated event data with proper formatting
✅ **Loading States**: All sections show loading indicators during data fetch
✅ **Empty States**: Appropriate messaging when no data is available
✅ **Navigation**: All sections link to relevant detail pages
✅ **Specific Alert Navigation**: Clicking alerts navigates to individual alert detail pages

## Database Integration

- 5 demo video alerts with various severities and statuses
- Proper property and camera associations
- Realistic timestamps and metadata

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
1. Real-time alert updates using WebSocket connections
2. Alert filtering and sorting options
3. Quick action buttons for alert resolution
4. Dashboard customization and widget arrangement
5. Alert summary statistics and trends
