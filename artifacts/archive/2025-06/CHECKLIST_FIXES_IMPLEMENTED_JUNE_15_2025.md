# Checklist Fixes Implemented - June 15, 2025

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Navigation Issues Fixed
- **Issue**: Edit and View Details buttons navigated to same page
- **Fix**: Updated ChecklistDetail component to properly respect the `editMode` prop and route path
- **Implementation**: Component now checks both the prop and the URL path to determine edit mode

### 2. ✅ Checklist Items Display Names
- **Issue**: Items had no names displayed
- **Fix**: Updated ChecklistItem type to include both `item_text` (API field) and `title` fields
- **Implementation**: Display logic now checks for `item.item_text || item.title || 'Item ${index + 1}'`

### 3. ✅ Checkbox Functionality Improved
- **Issue**: Unable to check/uncheck items
- **Fix**: Implemented auto-save functionality when checkboxes are toggled in edit mode
- **Implementation**: Checkboxes now call the complete/uncomplete item API endpoints automatically

### 4. ✅ Save Functionality Fixed
- **Issue**: Save failed with "Failed to update item" error
- **Fix**: Corrected API endpoint usage to use `/complete` endpoint instead of non-existent update endpoint
- **Implementation**: Save button now properly calls the complete item endpoint with correct payload

### 5. ✅ Comment Functionality Implemented
- **Issue**: Add comment fails
- **Fix**: Added complete comment system with backend API endpoints
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added `checklist_comments` table to database schema
  - Added comment service methods (addComment, getComments, deleteComment)
  - Added comment API routes (GET, POST, DELETE)
  - Updated frontend to use new comment endpoints
  - Comment button now enabled in edit mode

### 6. ✅ User Assignment Fixed
- **Issue**: Assign user error - SQL query had missing table alias
- **Fix**: Fixed the updateChecklist method to properly handle database queries
- **Implementation**: 
  - Separated tenant verification from update query
  - Fixed SQL join issue by updating checklist directly after verification

### 7. ✅ File Upload Implemented
- **Issue**: File upload showed "not yet implemented"
- **Fix**: Fully implemented file upload functionality
- **Implementation**: 
  - File selection dialog
  - Upload to API with proper multipart form data
  - File size validation (10MB limit)
  - Supported formats: Images, PDF, Documents, Spreadsheets

### 8. ✅ UI/UX Improvements
- **Issue**: View mode issues - buttons removed but functionality broken
- **Fix**: Properly implemented view/edit mode switching
- **Implementation**: 
  - Clear mode switching between view and edit states
  - Checkboxes, comments, and file attachments properly disabled in view mode
  - All interactive elements enabled only in edit mode

### 9. ✅ Unchecking Items
- **Issue**: API didn't support uncompleting items
- **Fix**: Added uncompleteItem method to service and DELETE endpoint
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added DELETE `/api/checklists/:id/items/:itemId/complete` endpoint
  - Service method deletes response record to uncomplete item

### 10. ✅ Status Restrictions Fixed (NEW)
- **Issue**: Checkboxes and other elements disabled when checklist status was 'pending'
- **Fix**: Updated all status checks to allow both 'in_progress' and 'pending' statuses
- **Implementation**: 
  - Checkbox now enabled for both 'in_progress' and 'pending' statuses
  - Notes field enabled for both statuses
  - Edit Mode button shows for both statuses
  - Auto-updates checklist to 'in_progress' when first item is checked

### 11. ✅ File Attachment Button Fixed (NEW)
- **Issue**: File attachment button only enabled when item has response_id
- **Fix**: Updated to check edit mode AND response_id
- **Implementation**: Button is disabled in view mode OR when item isn't completed yet

## API Endpoints Used
