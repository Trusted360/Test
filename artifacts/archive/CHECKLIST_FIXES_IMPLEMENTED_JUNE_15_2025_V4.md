### New Issue Fixed in V4

#### ✅ File Attachment Authentication Error Fixed
- **Issue**: Clicking file attachments returned authentication error: `{"success":false,"error":{"message":"Authentication required","code":"NO_TOKEN"}}`
- **Root Cause**: The frontend was trying to open the download URL in a new tab/window, which doesn't include the authentication token from localStorage
- **Fix**: 
  - Updated the file attachment click handler to use authenticated fetch instead of window.open
  - Downloads the file using fetch with Authorization header
  - Creates a blob from the response and triggers download programmatically
  - Maintains the original filename from the server response

## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes

1. **Updated ChecklistDetail.tsx**
   ```typescript
   // Changed from:
   window.open(`/api/checklists/attachments/${attachment.id}/download`, '_blank');
   
   // To authenticated download:
   const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
   const response = await fetch(url, {
     headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
   });
   // Create blob and trigger download
   ```

### Key Improvements

1. **Authenticated File Downloads**
   - Files are downloaded using fetch with proper authentication headers
   - No more authentication errors when clicking attachments
   - Seamless user experience with automatic downloads

2. **Proper File Handling**
   - Preserves original filenames from server
   - Creates temporary blob URLs for download
   - Cleans up resources after download
