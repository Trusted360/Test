# Video Analysis Page Fixes - June 16, 2025

## Summary
Fixed remaining issues with the video feed analysis page as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. Video Analysis Page (`src/dashboard/src/pages/Video/index.tsx`)
- **Removed AI Confidence Percentage**: Removed the percentage display chip that showed AI confidence scores
- **Removed "New" Status**: Changed all "new" status references to "reviewing" status
- **Removed "Actions Taken" Section**: Removed the display of actions taken from the event cards
- **Removed "Escalated" Status**: Removed the "escalated" status option, keeping only "reviewing" and "resolved"
- **Updated Statistics Card**: Changed "New Events" to "Active Events" to reflect the removal of the "new" status

### 2. Environment Info Removal (`src/dashboard/index.html`)
- **Removed Debug Script**: Removed the `<script src="/debug.js"></script>` tag that was displaying environment information at the bottom of all pages
- The debug.js file was creating a black bar at the bottom showing environment variables and location info

## Testing Instructions

1. Rebuild and restart the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker compose down -v
   docker compose up --build
   ```

2. Navigate to the Video Analysis page and verify:
   - No AI confidence percentages are shown on event cards
   - Events only show "reviewing" or "resolved" status (no "new" or "escalated")
   - No "Actions taken" section appears on event cards
   - The statistics show "Active Events" instead of "New Events"
   - No black environment info bar appears at the bottom of any page
