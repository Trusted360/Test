### New Issues Fixed in V2

#### 1. ✅ Comment Visibility Fixed
- **Issue**: Add comment works, but not visible
- **Root Cause**: Comments were being added inline in the dialog but not displayed properly
- **Fix**: Created a dedicated `ChecklistCommentDialog` component that:
  - Loads existing comments when opened
  - Displays comments in a list with user info and timestamps
  - Shows new comments immediately after adding
  - Allows deletion of own comments
  - Updates the comment list in real-time

#### 2. ✅ Expand/Comment Auto-Complete Issue Fixed
- **Issue**: Using expand to add comment is visible but auto completes task
- **Root Cause**: Click events were bubbling up and triggering unintended actions
- **Fix**: 
  - Added `event.stopPropagation()` to all action buttons
  - Separated comment dialog from expand/collapse functionality
  - Comments now open in a modal dialog instead of inline
  - Expand/collapse no longer affects item completion status

#### 3. ✅ File Attachment Click Issue Fixed
- **Issue**: Unable to click file attachment
- **Root Cause**: File attachment chips were not properly handling click events
- **Fix**: 
  - Added `onClick` handler with `event.stopPropagation()`
  - File attachments now properly open in new tab
  - Added tooltip for disabled state when item not completed
  - Wrapped disabled button in span to show tooltip properly

#### 4. ✅ Due Date Edit Functionality Added
- **Issue**: Unable to edit date
- **Root Cause**: No UI component for editing due dates
- **Fix**: 
  - Added "Edit Due Date" button in edit mode
  - Created due date dialog with DatePicker component
  - Integrated with MUI X Date Pickers
  - Fixed DatePicker syntax for latest MUI version
  - Due date updates properly save to backend
