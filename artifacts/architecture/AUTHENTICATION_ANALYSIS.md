# Authentication System Analysis

## Current Implementation Assessment

Based on examination of the existing codebase, here's what we have for authentication:

### ‚úÖ Strengths
- JWT-based authentication implemented
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Middleware for route protection
- User model with proper validation
- Login/register endpoints exist

### üîç Areas to Investigate
- Role-based access control implementation
- Token refresh mechanism
- Session management
- Password reset functionality
- Multi-tenant support for properties/organizations

### üö® Security Concerns
- Hard-coded JWT secret in docker-compose
- Need to verify proper token validation
- Check for XSS/CSRF protections
- Validate input sanitization

## Next Steps
1. Examine auth middleware implementation
2. Test authentication flows
3. Document API contracts
4. Identify gaps for audit system requirements
