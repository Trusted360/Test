## Technical Specifications

### User Roles Hierarchy
1. **admin** - Full system administrator access
2. **manager** - Property manager with limited admin access  
3. **staff** - Staff member with operational access
4. **viewer** - Read-only access to reports and data

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/users` - List all users with roles
- `POST /api/users` - Create new user with roles
- `PUT /api/users/:id` - Update user and roles
- `DELETE /api/users/:id` - Delete user (hard delete)
- `POST /api/users/:id/reset-password` - Reset user password
- `GET /api/users/roles/list` - Get available roles

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Roles table
CREATE TABLE roles (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- User roles junction table
CREATE TABLE user_roles (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  role_id INTEGER REFERENCES roles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(user_id, role_id)
);
```

## Development Notes

### Docker Commands
```bash
# Full rebuild
docker compose down -v && docker compose up

# Rebuild specific service
docker compose build api && docker compose restart api
```

### Testing Accounts
- **Admin:** admin@trusted360.com (has admin role via roles system)
- **Users:** Can be created and assigned roles via Users page

### Project Rules (from CLAUDE.md)
- Docker-only development environment
- Idempotent build - system must be fully rebuildable
- Migrations are canonical - update existing files
- Real features only - no mocking unless requested
- User-driven complexity - validate before adding complexity
