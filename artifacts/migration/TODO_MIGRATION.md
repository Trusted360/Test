- [ ] Create camera feed simulators

## üìã PHASE 5: Production Readiness (Week 5-6)

### Observability
- [ ] Implement structured logging (JSON)
- [ ] Add Prometheus metrics
- [ ] Set up Grafana dashboards
- [ ] Implement distributed tracing
- [ ] Add health check endpoints

### DevOps Pipeline
- [ ] Create CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add automated testing in pipeline
- [ ] Implement deployment automation
- [ ] Add environment promotion process
- [ ] Create rollback procedures

### Documentation

- [ ] Deployment guide
- [ ] User manual
- [ ] Developer onboarding guide
- [ ] Architecture decision records

## üéØ SUCCESS METRICS

- [ ] Single command deployment works (`docker-compose up`)
- [ ] All API endpoints go through proper authentication
- [ ] No business logic in frontend components
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage on core modules
- [ ] Sub-second response times for critical endpoints
- [ ] Proper error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Security audit passes (no hard-coded secrets, proper HTTPS, etc.)
