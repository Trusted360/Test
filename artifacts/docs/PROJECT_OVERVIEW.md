# Trusted360 - Security Audit Platform

## ðŸŽ‰ **Current Status: BASELINE COMPLETE** âœ…

**Last Updated**: May 26, 2024  
**Phase**: Ready for POC Development  
**Environment**: Development Ready

## Project Intent

Trusted360 has been successfully transformed from a meal planning application into a comprehensive security audit platform foundation. The existing infrastructure has been leveraged while completely replacing the domain logic with security-focused features.

## Target System Architecture

### Core Modules
- **Audit Engine**: Core business logic for security audits and compliance checking
- **Camera Ingest**: Real-time video/image processing and analysis pipeline
- **Alert Queue**: Event-driven notification and escalation system
- **Edge Box Integration**: Communication with on-premise security devices
- **PMS Integration**: Property Management System connectivity
- **Notification Services**: Email/SMS alerting capabilities

### Key Features
- Real-time security monitoring
- Automated compliance auditing
- Multi-tenant property management
- Role-based access control
- Alert escalation workflows
- Audit trail and reporting

## Technology Stack (Retained)

### Infrastructure (Keep)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express and GraphQL
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis caching
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role/claims middleware
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **Reverse Proxy**: Traefik (migrating from nginx)

### Frontend (Rebuild)
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript (keep framework, rebuild components)
- **State Management**: Context API or Redux (TBD)
- **UI Library**: Material-UI or similar (TBD)

## Migration Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Infrastructure cleanup and security hardening
2. **Phase 2**: Authentication system validation and enhancement
3. **Phase 3**: Domain model replacement (audit entities)
4. **Phase 4**: API contract redesign for audit workflows
5. **Phase 5**: Frontend rebuild for security dashboard
6. **Phase 6**: Integration testing and deployment pipeline

## âœ… Success Criteria - ACHIEVED

- [x] Single command deployment (`./setup-local-dev.sh` + `./start-dev.sh`)
- [x] Proper authentication with role-based access
- [x] API-first architecture (no UI bypassing backend)
- [ ] Comprehensive testing suite (next phase)
- [ ] Production-ready observability (next phase)
- [x] Secure configuration management

## ðŸš€ Next Phase: POC Development

With the baseline complete, the next phase focuses on:
1. **Audit System Core** - Dynamic checklists and workflows
2. **Camera Integration** - Device registration and feed management
3. **Alert System** - Real-time incident detection and notifications
4. **Facility Management** - Site profiles and device monitoring

**Ready to begin building the core Trusted 360 security features!**
