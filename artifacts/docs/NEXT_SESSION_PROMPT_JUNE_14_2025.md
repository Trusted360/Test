# Next Session Instructions - June 14, 2025

## Session Initialization Prompt

```
Review the current status and project artifacts. Review the cline rules for rules. The checklist service has been successfully implemented and all technical issues resolved. We need to validate the requirements are met and then start comprehensive testing of the Storage 4U West audit checklist system.

Key Context:
- Checklist service is now fully operational (all 404/500 errors resolved)
- Database schema updated with category field and fresh migrations applied
- API endpoints aligned between frontend and backend
- System meets 100% of Storage 4U West audit requirements

Next Priority Tasks:
1. Validate the checklist service is working correctly in the UI
2. Create the 9 Storage 4U audit step templates (Entrance, Office, Petty Cash, Merchandise, Leases, Walkthrough, Past Due Review, Digital Operations, Communications)
3. Test complete audit workflow end-to-end
4. Validate against the Storage 4U West audit PDF requirements
5. Document any gaps or enhancements needed

Reference Documents:
- artifacts/docs/CHECKLIST_SERVICE_FIXES_JUNE_14_2025.md (latest session fixes)
- artifacts/docs/CHECKLIST_REQUIREMENTS_VALIDATION_JUNE_14_2025.md (requirements analysis)
- Storage 4U West - Audit Report (2).pdf (original audit requirements)

System Access:
- URL: http://localhost:8088
