# Infrastructure Assessment - What to Keep vs Replace

## ✅ KEEP - Solid Foundation

### Authentication & Security
- JWT implementation in `src/api/src/middleware/auth.js`
- User model and authentication routes
- Password hashing and validation
- Role-based middleware structure

### Database Infrastructure
- PostgreSQL setup with proper migrations
- Redis caching layer
- Database connection pooling
- Migration management system

### API Architecture
- Express.js server setup
- GraphQL integration with Apollo Server
- Middleware pipeline (cors, helmet, etc.)
- Error handling patterns

### DevOps Foundation
- Docker containerization
- Docker Compose orchestration
- Environment variable management
- Service dependency management

### Project Structure
- Clean separation of concerns
- Modular directory organization
- Configuration management patterns

## 🔄 MODIFY - Good Foundation, Wrong Domain

### GraphQL Schema
- Keep: Schema definition patterns, resolver structure
- Replace: All type definitions (User -> AuditUser, Recipe -> AuditEvent, etc.)
- Enhance: Add audit-specific types (Camera, Alert, EdgeBox, etc.)

### Database Models
- Keep: Model definition patterns, validation approaches
- Replace: All domain entities
- Add: Audit trail tables, event logging, device management

### API Routes
- Keep: Route organization, middleware usage
- Replace: All business logic endpoints
- Add: Camera ingest, alert management, audit workflows

## ❌ REPLACE - Wrong Domain Entirely

### Frontend Components
- All React components (meal planning -> security dashboard)
- All page layouts and navigation
- All business logic and state management
- All UI workflows and user journeys

### Business Logic
- All service layer logic
- All domain-specific utilities
- All workflow implementations
- All data processing logic

### Database Schema
- All tables except users/auth related
- All domain-specific indexes
- All business rule constraints

## 🚨 FIX IMMEDIATELY - Security Issues

### Configuration
- Hard-coded JWT secret in docker-compose.yml
- Missing environment variable validation
- No secrets management strategy
- Development credentials in version control

### Security Headers
- Missing security middleware configuration
- No rate limiting implementation
- Missing input validation on many endpoints
- No audit logging for security events
