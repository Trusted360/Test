*Field-Ops & Edge-AI Security for Self-Storage**

### **1. Executive Summary**

  

Self-storage operators juggle paper audits, ageing CCTV and thin staffing. Errors slip, footage is ignored, and minor faults become expensive claims. Trusted 360 unifies site walks and camera feeds in one SaaS platform. Attendants record audits on a phone; AI running on an on-site Jetson Orin Nano flags leaks, trespass and damage in real time. Only lightweight alerts leave the property, so bandwidth, latency and privacy worries vanish. Result: faster rounds, fewer incidents, tighter margins.

### **2. The Problem**

|**Pain point**|**Current reality**|**Impact**|
|---|---|---|
|**Manual audits**|Checklists on clipboards, photos stored locally|Inconsistent data, no proof for insurers|
|**Passive video**|DVR reviewed only after a complaint|Missed threats, slow response|
|**Bandwidth costs**|Cloud AI demands high upstream and GPU time|Unpredictable OpEx, poor rural connectivity|
|**Liability**|Limited evidence trail|Higher claims, legal risk|

### **3. Our Solution**

  

#### **3.1 Audit Engine**

- Dynamic check-lists mapped to corporate policy
    
- Offline-first PWA (no app-store friction)
    
- Time–geo stamped entries, photo capture, e-signature
    
- Immediate sync to cloud dashboard and CSV/PDF export
    

  

#### **3.2 Vision AI**

- YOLO-v9 models tuned for corridors, gates and car parks
    
- Events: intrusion, vehicle stuck, smoke/leak, door left ajar, tamper
    
- Confidence threshold adapts per site via feedback loop
    

  

#### **3.3 Trusted 360 Edge Box**

- **Jetson Orin Nano 8 GB** (40 TOPS) in fan-less DIN-rail case
    
- Dual GbE NICs (LAN to NVR, WAN to router)
    
- 128 GB industrial micro-SD for 24 h alert clip cache
    
- DeepStream ➝ TensorRT pipeline, MQTT over TLS to cloud
    
- Signed OTA model updates; SSH locked down, full disk encryption
    

  

Bandwidth cut ≈ 95 %; latency < 80 ms; full-res footage never exits site.

### **4. Market Opportunity**

- **51 k US facilities**, > 65 % run with ≤ 2 staff.
    
- Operators accept **≤ $500 /site/month** when ROI is clear.
    
- Early anchor client manages 10 sites—pilot under way.
    
- Expansion path: regional chains (20–100 sites), then national REITs.

### **5. Competitive Edge**

1. **Dual Focus** – rivals do either audits or analytics, never both.
    
2. **Edge First** – Jetson brings AI in-house, slicing OpEx and appeasing insurers.
    
3. **Open Integration** – REST/Webhooks feed SiteLink, Yardi, Slack, Zapier.
    
4. **Rapid Iteration** – model fine-tuned by user feedback without code.
    
5. **Switching Friction** – historical audit data and model weights discourage churn.

### **6. Technical Architecture**

- **Cloud:** Kubernetes (EKS), Postgres, Redis, Grafana/Prometheus; SOC 2 roadmap.
    
- **Mobile:** Vuetify PWA, service-worker caching, push notifications.
    
- **Security:** SSO/SAML, row-level tenancy, encrypted transit & rest, tamper logs.
    
- **APIs:** GraphQL for internal, REST+Webhook for clients, Terraform-backed infra-code.

### **12. Conclusion**

  

Trusted 360 turns idle CCTV and manual rounds into a live, accountable security loop. Edge AI keeps data private and costs stable; SaaS workflows keep staff honest and claims low. For operators, that means fewer fires to fight—literally and figuratively—and a healthier NOI. For us, it is a scalable, defensible foothold in an industry that has waited too long for modern tools.
