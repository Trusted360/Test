# Trusted360 - TODO Tasks

## ðŸ”´ High Priority Tasks

### 1. Fix Demo Account Setup
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED  
**Priority**: High  
**Description**: Demo accounts created during database initialization are not working after rebuild.

**Demo Accounts**: These should be stood up at initilzation 
- Admin: admin@trusted360.com / demo123
- User: user@trusted360.com / demo123

**Issue**: These accounts either don't exist or have incorrect password hashes.

**Action Items**:
- [x] Check if demo accounts exist in database
- [x] Verify password hashing for existing demo accounts
- [x] Create/recreate demo accounts with proper bcrypt hashing
- [x] Test login with demo credentials
- [x] Update database initialization scripts if needed

**Files Modified**:
- `src/api/migrations/20250603000000_create_demo_accounts.js` - New migration to create demo accounts

**Completion Notes**: 
- Created new migration that automatically creates demo accounts during database setup
- Accounts are created with proper bcrypt hashing (salt rounds: 12)
- Migration checks for existing accounts to prevent duplicates
- Successfully tested login with admin@trusted360.com / demo123

### 2. Fix Login Error Display UI Issue
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED (June 5, 2025)  
**Priority**: High  
**Description**: Login error messages not displaying in UI despite proper backend error handling.

**Root Cause Identified**:
- React component re-rendering issues caused by AuthContext state changes during async operations
- Server-side validation triggers component re-renders that clear form fields and error state
- API interceptors potentially interfering with error handling flow

**Solution Implemented**:
- [x] Enhanced ref-based state persistence system
- [x] Implemented state restoration logic with useEffect hooks
- [x] Added force update mechanism for triggering restoration
- [x] Improved API interceptor for 401 error handling
- [x] Comprehensive testing across all error scenarios

**Final Status**:
- âœ… **Client-side validation**: Works perfectly (invalid email format shows error, retains form values)
- âœ… **Server-side validation**: Now works perfectly (invalid credentials show error, form values retained)
- âœ… **Backend error handling**: Working perfectly
- âœ… **Error parsing**: JavaScript correctly processes server responses
- âœ… **UI Error Display**: Error messages display prominently in red alert boxes
- âœ… **Form Persistence**: Email and password fields retain values after failed login
- âœ… **User Experience**: Consistent, reliable error handling across all scenarios

**Files Modified**:
- `src/dashboard/src/pages/Auth/Login.tsx` - Enhanced with ref-based state persistence system
- `src/dashboard/src/services/api.js` - Improved axios response interceptor
- `artifacts/docs/LOGIN_ERROR_HANDLING_INVESTIGATION.md` - Complete investigation and resolution documentation

**Testing Results**:
```
All scenarios now working:
âœ… Invalid email format: Shows error, retains form values
âœ… Invalid credentials: Shows "Invalid email or password. Please check your credentials and try again."
âœ… Form persistence: Email and password fields retain values after failed login
âœ… Error clearing: Error clears when user starts typing
âœ… Loading states: Proper loading indicators during authentication
```

**Architecture Benefits**:
- Simple and maintainable ref-based solution
- Robust handling of React component re-renders
- Self-contained logic within Login component
- Minimal performance overhead
- Extensible to other forms with similar issues

## ðŸ“‹ Task Assignment Guidelines

**Before Starting Any Task**:
1. Review current system status in CURRENT_STATUS_JUNE_3_2025.md
2. Test current functionality to understand baseline
3. Create backup of any files being modified
4. Document changes made during implementation

**Testing Requirements**:
- All authentication-related changes must be tested end-to-end
- Verify both API and frontend functionality
- Test with multiple user accounts
- Confirm no regression in existing features

**Documentation Updates**:
