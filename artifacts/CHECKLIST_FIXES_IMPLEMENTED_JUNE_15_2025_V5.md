### New Features Added in V5

#### ✅ Files Now Open in New Tab Instead of Downloading
- **Request**: User wanted files to open in a new tab or viewer instead of downloading
- **Implementation**: 
  - Updated frontend to open files in new browser tab using blob URLs
  - Modified backend to use `inline` content-disposition for PDFs and images
  - Other file types still download as before
  - Fallback to download if popup is blocked

## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes (ChecklistDetail.tsx)
```typescript
// Files now open in new tab with authentication
const blob = await response.blob();
const url = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);
const newTab = window.open(url, '_blank');
```

### Backend Changes (checklist.routes.js)
```javascript
// Smart content-disposition based on file type
const inlineTypes = ['application/pdf', 'image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png', 'image/gif'];
const disposition = inlineTypes.includes(attachment.file_type) ? 'inline' : 'attachment';
res.setHeader('Content-Disposition', `${disposition}; filename="${attachment.file_name}"`);
```

## Current Limitations

### File Attachments Require Item Completion
- **Current Design**: Attachments are linked to checklist responses in the database
- **Database Schema**: `checklist_attachments` table has a foreign key to `checklist_responses`
- **Implication**: An item must be marked as complete (creating a response) before files can be attached

### Potential Future Enhancement
To allow attachments at any time, we would need to:
1. Modify the database schema to allow attachments to link directly to checklist items
2. Update the backend service to handle this new relationship
3. Update the frontend to allow uploads without completion

This would be a significant architectural change that should be discussed with the team.

## Testing Guide

### File Viewing in New Tab
1. Navigate to a checklist with attachments
2. Click on a PDF or image attachment
3. ✅ File opens in new browser tab
4. ✅ PDFs display in browser's PDF viewer
5. ✅ Images display directly in browser
6. ✅ Other files (docs, spreadsheets) download as before

### Authentication Still Works
1. ✅ Files open with proper authentication
2. ✅ No authentication errors
3. ✅ Secure access maintained

### Popup Blocker Handling
1. If browser blocks popups:
   - ✅ File downloads instead
   - ✅ User sees message about popup being blocked

## API Endpoints Summary

### All Working Endpoints
- `PUT /api/checklists/{id}/status` - Update checklist status
- `GET /api/checklists/attachments/{attachmentId}/download` - Stream files with smart disposition
- `POST /api/checklists/{id}/attachments` - Upload attachments (requires response_id)

## Notes
- All requested fixes have been implemented
- Files now open in browser when possible (PDFs, images)
- The attachment system still requires item completion due to database design
- Consider future enhancement to allow attachments without completion
