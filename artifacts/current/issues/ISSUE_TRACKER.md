## Critical Issues (P0 - Blocking)

### ðŸ”´ Settings Module - Complete Failure
**Status:** RESOLVED  
**Component:** Settings  
**Description:** ~~All settings functionality is non-functional~~ **FIXED:** Missing settings routes file
- [x] Failed to load settings - **FIXED:** Created `/src/api/src/routes/settings.routes.js`
- [x] User preferences fail to save - **FIXED:** Added settings routes to main router
- [x] Integration settings fail to save - **FIXED:** Settings API endpoints now working
- [x] Camera settings fail to save - **FIXED:** All settings endpoints functional
- [x] Notifications fail to save - **FIXED:** Settings service restored

**Resolution:** Settings routes were missing from the newer API structure. Created settings.routes.js and integrated into main routes.

### ðŸ”´ Properties Module - Creation Failure
**Status:** RESOLVED  
**Component:** Properties  
**Description:** ~~Unable to create new properties~~ **FIXED:** Column name mismatch in property service
- [x] Investigate creation workflow - **FIXED:** Property service using wrong column name
- [x] Fix database constraints - **FIXED:** Changed `property_type` to `property_type_id` in service
- [x] Test property assignment flow - **FIXED:** Property creation now working

**Resolution:** Property service was using `property_type` column name but database has `property_type_id`. Updated all references in property.service.js.

### ðŸ”´ IAM Issues
**Status:** CLARIFIED  
**Component:** User Management  
**Description:** ~~Identity and Access Management problems~~ **ANALYSIS:** Authentication works, missing user management features
- [x] Define specific IAM failures - **ANALYSIS:** Auth middleware and permissions are working correctly
- [x] Fix permission system - **VERIFIED:** Role-based access control is functional
- [x] Test role-based access - **VERIFIED:** Admin/user roles properly restricted

**Analysis:** Core IAM functionality (authentication, authorization, role-based access) is working properly. The "IAM issues" appear to be missing user management features (create/edit/delete users) rather than broken authentication. This should be reclassified as a feature request for user management admin interface.
