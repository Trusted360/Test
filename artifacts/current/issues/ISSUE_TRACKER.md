## High Priority Issues (P1 - Major Features)

### ðŸ”´ Auditing & Reporting System Overhaul
**Status:** NEEDS COMPREHENSIVE REDESIGN  
**Component:** Auditing/Reporting  
**Description:** Two separate implementations exist (Property Manager Reporting & basic Auditing) but neither adequately serves the critical need for comprehensive activity tracking and reporting

**Current State:**

- Basic Auditing: Limited scope, doesn't capture all user activities

**Requirements for Proper Implementation:**

  - [ ] Checklist creation, assignment, and completion with timestamps
  - [ ] Video events (triggered, resolved, checklist generation)
