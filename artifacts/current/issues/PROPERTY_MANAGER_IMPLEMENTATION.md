# Property Manager Reporting System Implementation

**Completed:** 2025-06-24  
**Status:** Fully Implemented and Build Verified

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive property manager reporting system focused on operational insights rather than technical audit trails. The system tracks what was completed on properties, what issues came up, and what actions were taken.

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema Enhancements

#### 1. Enhanced Checklist Response Tracking
```sql
-- Added to checklist_responses table:
issue_severity VARCHAR(50) -- none, minor, moderate, major, critical
requires_action BOOLEAN
issue_description TEXT
issue_metadata JSONB
```

#### 2. Action Items System
```sql
-- New table: action_items
- Tracks follow-up tasks from inspection issues
- Links to checklist responses
- Supports assignment, status tracking, and cost estimation
- Includes vendor management fields
```

#### 3. Supporting Tables
- `action_item_updates` - Tracks all changes and notes
- `property_inspection_summary` - Aggregated inspection data
- `recurring_issues` - Pattern identification and analysis
- `property_manager_metrics` - Real-time KPIs

#### 4. Database Views
- `active_issues_by_property` - Quick property health overview
- `recent_inspection_results` - Inspection summary with issue counts

### API Implementation

#### Service Layer (`propertyManager.service.js`)
- `getPropertyHealthDashboard()` - Real-time dashboard data
- `getChecklistCompletionReport()` - Detailed inspection reports
- `getActionItemsReport()` - Task management and tracking
- `getStaffPerformanceReport()` - Productivity metrics
- `getRecurringIssuesReport()` - Pattern analysis
- `createActionItem()` - Create/update tasks
