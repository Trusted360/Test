# Audit Logging Fix Summary - June 19, 2025

## Problem Identified
The audit system was implemented but activities weren't being tracked because:
1. The AuditService was initialized but not injected into other services
2. No audit events were being logged when users performed actions

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Service Injection (src/api/src/index.js)
- Added injection of AuditService into ChecklistService and VideoAnalysisService
- This allows these services to log audit events when actions occur

### 2. Checklist Service Audit Logging (src/api/src/services/checklist.service.js)
Added audit logging for:
- **Checklist Creation**: Logs when a new checklist is created from a template
- **Item Completion**: Logs when checklist items are marked as complete
- **Checklist Completion**: Logs when an entire checklist is marked as complete

### 3. Video Analysis Service Audit Logging (src/api/src/services/videoAnalysis.service.js)
Added audit logging for:
- **Alert Triggered**: Logs when video alerts are triggered
- **Alert Resolved**: Logs when alerts are resolved by users
- **Service Ticket Creation**: Logs when service tickets are created

## How to Test

### Quick Test Script
Run the provided test script:
```bash
./test-audit-logging.sh
```

This script will:
1. Rebuild Docker containers with the fixes
2. Wait for services to be ready
3. Provide instructions for testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Rebuild the containers** (required to apply the fixes):
   ```bash
   docker compose down -v
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```

2. **Log into the app**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:8088
   - Login with demo@example.com / password123

3. **Test Checklist Tracking**:
   - Go to Checklists page
   - Create a new checklist
   - Complete some checklist items
   - Mark the checklist as complete

4. **Test Video Alert Tracking**:
   - Go to Video Analysis page
   - Create or resolve alerts
   - Create service tickets

5. **View Audit Reports**:
   - Navigate to the Audit Reports page
   - You should now see all the activities you performed
   - Check the Recent Activity section
   - View operational metrics

### Database Verification
You can also verify directly in the database:

```bash
# View recent audit logs
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d trusted360_db -c "SELECT event_type_id, action, description, created_at FROM audit_logs ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;"

# View operational metrics
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d trusted360_db -c "SELECT * FROM operational_metrics ORDER BY metric_date DESC;"

# Count audit events by category
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d trusted360_db -c "SELECT aet.category, COUNT(*) as event_count FROM audit_logs al JOIN audit_event_types aet ON al.event_type_id = aet.id GROUP BY aet.category;"
```

## What's Being Tracked Now

### Checklist Events
- Checklist created (with template name, property, due date)
- Checklist item completed (with item text, response value)
- Checklist completed (with completion timestamp)

### Video Analysis Events
- Alert triggered (with camera, alert type, severity)
- Alert resolved (with resolution notes, resolver)
- Service ticket created (with priority, assignment)

### Business Context
Each event includes:
- User who performed the action
- Property where it occurred
- Timestamp of the event
- Relevant metadata for reporting
- Business impact information (urgency, cost, etc.)

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fixes** using the steps above
2. **Verify data appears** in the Audit Reports page
3. **Check operational metrics** are being updated

The audit system should now properly track all activities and display them in your reports!
